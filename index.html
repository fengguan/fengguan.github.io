Hello world!

Who am I?

What am made of?

Where am I going to?

What is happiness?

When will I earn enough money? and what will happen?

How to deal with others such that I never regret, and everyone will be happy?

Am I real? Is the world real?

Is there a/many God?

If the world is real, why it is understandable?

Are we really understanding the world or we are just fooling ourselves?

If the world is not real, what are we actually doing when we do research?

Is science is a reflection of human emotion?
